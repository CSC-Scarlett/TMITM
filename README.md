Welcome to our big project's main repository!

Repo rules:

Confirm conflicting commits with the rest of the code team before merging into main
Use concise and descriptive descriptions for each commit (not just "Updated The Man in the Moon")
Please please please remember to pull the newest commits before working on the code to avoid conflicting changes!! This will save all of us a lot of trouble
